    <h2>I created these cookies while camping, they are the tastiest campfire cookies you will ever eat! You can also make them at home over the stove.</h2>
<p>
    Toasty Campfire Cookies are a delicious treat that can be made over a campfire or on the stove.
    The cookies are made with graham crackers, chocolate chips, and marshmallows.
    They are perfect for any occasion!

<p>
    These cookies are so easy to make and they taste amazing!
    You can use any type of chocolate chip you want, but I prefer dark chocolate chips because they have a richer flavor than milk chocolate chips.
    If you don't have graham crackers on hand, you can use any type of cookie or cracker that you like.
