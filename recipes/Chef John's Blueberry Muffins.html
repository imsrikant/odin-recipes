    <h2>I decided to push the envelope in this recipe for blueberry muffins and toss in 2 cups of blueberries!</h2>
    <p>Chef John's Blueberry Muffins are a mouthwatering treat that perfectly captures the essence of fresh, juicy blueberries. These muffins are incredibly moist and tender, with a delicate crumb that will leave you craving for more.</p>
    <p>The recipe starts by combining flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, melted butter, milk, an egg, and a hint of vanilla extract are whisked together until well combined.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>

<li><h4>Step : 5</h4></li>
<p>Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.</p>

<li><h4>Step : 6</h4></li>
<p>Place muffin cups on center rack of the preheated oven and bake until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</p>
