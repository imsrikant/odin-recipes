    <h2>I decided to push the envelope in this recipe for blueberry muffins and toss in 2 cups of blueberries!</h2>
    <p>Chef John's Blueberry Muffins are a mouthwatering treat that perfectly captures the essence of fresh, juicy blueberries. These muffins are incredibly moist and tender, with a delicate crumb that will leave you craving for more.</p>
    <p>The recipe starts by combining flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, melted butter, milk, an egg, and a hint of vanilla extract are whisked together until well combined.</p>
